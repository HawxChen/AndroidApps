Matlab has a feature for converting *.m files to *.jar files. This helps to run codes written in Matlab in a Java program. The available folders:

1- NeuroMovieClient: collects raw data from EEG sensor.
2- FeatureExt: extracts features from collected raw data.
3- Comparator: compares two signals to check if they belong to the same subject.

Note: these are sample codes to help students develop thier own application.
