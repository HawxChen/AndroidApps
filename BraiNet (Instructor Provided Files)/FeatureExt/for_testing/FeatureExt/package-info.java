/** 
 * <p>This package was created using MATLAB Builder JA. The classes included in this 
 * package are wrappers around M functions which were used when compiling this package 
 * in MATLAB. These classes have public methods that provide access to the M functions 
 * used by MATLAB Builder JA during compilation.</p>
 * <h3><b>IMPORTANT : </b>What you need to use this package successfully :</h3>
 * <h3>MATLAB Compiler Runtime (MCR)</h3>
 * <p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>MCR is the collection of platform specific native libraries required to execute M functions exported by the classes of this package</li>
 * <li>It can be made available either by installing MATLAB, MATLAB Compiler and MATLAB Builder JA or by just running MCRInstaller executable</li>
 * <li>This package is compatible with MCR version 8.3 only.</li>
 * <li>Please contact the creator of this package for specific details about the MCR (e.g what version of MATLAB it originated with since MCR version is tied to the version of MATLAB)</li>
 * </ul> 
 * </p>
 * <p><b>NOTE: </b>Creating the first instance of one of the classes from this package is more time
 * consuming than creating subsequent instances since the native libraries from the MCR
 * get loaded the first time; the subsequent instances of classes are created more 
 * quickly since they use the already loaded native libraries.</p>
 * <h3>javabuilder.jar</h3> 
 * <p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>Provides classes that act as the bridge between your application and the MCR</li>
 * <li>Located in the $MCR/toolbox/javabuilder/jar directory ($MCR is the root of either MATLAB or MCRInstaller installation)</li>
 * <li><code>FeatureExt</code> package will only work with the javabuilder.jar file included with MCR version 8.3.</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p> 
 * <p><b>NOTE: </b><code>com.mathworks.toolbox.javabuilder.MWArray</code> is one of many data 
 * conversion classes provided in javabuilder.jar. MWArray is an abstract class representing a 
 * MATLAB array. Each MATLAB array type has a corresponding concrete class type in the 
 * MWArray class hierarchy. The public methods that represent M functions, for the classes 
 * of <code>FeatureExt</code> package, can take instances of these concrete classes as 
 * input. These methods can also take native JAVA primitive or array types as input. These native 
 * types get converted to appropriate MWArray types using data conversion rules provides by 
 * MATLAB Builder JA e.g a JAVA primitive type double gets converted into an instance of
 * MWNumericArray (a subclass of MWArray)</p>
