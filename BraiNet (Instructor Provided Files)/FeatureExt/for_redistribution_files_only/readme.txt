MATLAB Builder JA Read Me

1. Prerequisites for Deployment 

. Verify the MATLAB Compiler Runtime (MCR) is installed and ensure you    
  have installed version 8.3 (R2014a). 

. If the MCR is not installed, do the following:
  (1) enter
  
      >>mcrinstaller
      
      at MATLAB prompt. The MCRINSTALLER command displays the 
      location of the MCR Installer.

  (2) run the MCR Installer.

Or download the Windows 64-bit version of the MCR for R2014a 
from the MathWorks Web site by navigating to

   http://www.mathworks.com/products/compiler/mcr/index.html
   
 
For more information about the MCR and the MCR Installer, see 
Distribution to End Users in the MATLAB Compiler documentation  
in the MathWorks Documentation Center. 

. Ensure you have the version 1.7 of the Java Development Kit (JDK) to integrate the 
  component. 

. FeatureExt.jar must be included in your CLASSPATH.

. javabuilder.jar must be included in your CLASSPATH. javabuilder.jar 
  can be found in: 
  
  <mcr_root>*\toolbox\javabuilder\jar\win64\javabuilder.jar
  

NOTE: You will need administrator rights to run MCRInstaller. 
 
2. Files to Deploy and Package

-FeatureExt.jar
-MCRInstaller.exe 
   - if end users are unable to download the MCR using the above  
     link, include it when building your component by clicking 
     the "Add MCR" link in the Deployment Tool
-Javadoc   
   - javadoc for FeatureExt is in the doc directory. While  
     distributing the javadoc, this entire directory should be distributed.
-This readme file

* NOTE: <mcr_root> is the directory where MCR is installed on the target machine.


5. Appendix 

A. Linux x86-64 systems:   
   On the target machine, add the MCR directory to the environment variable 
   LD_LIBRARY_PATH by issuing the following commands:

        NOTE: <mcr_root> is the directory where MCR is installed
              on the target machine.         

            setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH
                $LD_LIBRARY_PATH:
                <mcr_root>/v83/runtime/glnxa64:
                <mcr_root>/v83/bin/glnxa64:
                <mcr_root>/v83/sys/os/glnxa64
            setenv XAPPLRESDIR <mcr_root>/v83/X11/app-defaults
 
B. Mac systems: 
   On the target machine, add the MCR directory to the environment variable 
   DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH by issuing the following commands:

        NOTE: <mcr_root> is the directory where MCR is installed
              on the target machine.         

            setenv DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH
                $DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH:
                <mcr_root>/v83/runtime/maci64:
                <mcr_root>/v83/sys/os/maci64:
                <mcr_root>/v83/bin/maci64


   For more detail information about setting MCR paths, see Distribution to End Users in 
   the MATLAB Builder JA documentation in the MathWorks Documentation Center.


       
        NOTE: To make these changes persistent after logout on Linux or 
              Mac machines, modify the .cshrc file to include this  
              setenv command.
        NOTE: On Windows, the environment variable syntax utilizes 
              backslashes (\), delimited by semi-colons (;). 
              On Linux or Mac, the environment variable syntax utilizes   
              forward slashes (/), delimited by colons (:).  
        NOTE: On Maci64, ensure you are using 64-bit JVM.
