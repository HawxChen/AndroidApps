Abstract
----------
In this paper we outline a new approach to authentication based on a userâ€™s brain signal response (i.e. EEG signal) to visual stimuli. Signals are sent to either a remote cloud server, or a nearby (but computationally inferior) fog server for analysis and final authentication. The implementation of such a system is described, and an analysis of the tradeoff between cloud and fog servers are compared.
